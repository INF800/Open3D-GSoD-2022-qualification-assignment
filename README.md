# Open3D-GSoD-2022-qualification-assignment

**Deadline:** May 06, 23:59 UTC / May 07, 05:29 AM IST

### Tasks

You’re expected to:

- [ ] Compile Open3D from source: http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/compilation.html.
- [ ] Write C++ function `open3d::geometry::TriangleMesh::IdenticallyColoredConnectedComponents`
- [ ] Write Python binding `open3d.geometry.TriangleMesh.identically_colored_connected_components`.
- [ ] Write `examples/cpp/Solution.cpp` to read the input mesh `test_mesh.ply`, find identically-colored connected components. **Change the build system** so that an executable can be build.
- [ ] Write `examples/python/solution.py` to read the input mesh `test_mesh.ply`, find identically-colored connected components and print results.
- [ ] Output the result of task 3 or 4 (their results shall be the same) to `examples/result.txt`.
- [ ] Write C++ and Python unit tests integrated with Open3D’s unit test system.
- [ ] Document your code, the algorithm used, how to build and run, and etc.
